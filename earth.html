<center>The Earth</center>
Earth, also called the world  and, less frequently, terra (especially in science fiction) or Gaia, is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The Earth's biodiversity has evolved over hundreds of millions of years, expanding continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions. Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on the planet are extinct, Earth is currently home to 10–14 million species of life. Over 7.2 billion humans who depend upon its biosphere and minerals. The Earth's human population is divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade, and communication media
